Wikidata Question-Answering System


<p align="center"><img src="./image.jpg" alt="A cute wrap, the mascot of Nixwrap" style="width:400px;"/></p>

This project aims to allow users to ask questions naturally and have the system retrieve relevant information from Wikidata to construct a response while also providing sources to the information. It employs a retrieval-augmented generation approach where the system first fetches data points from Wikidata and then weaves them into the context of a large language model response. 

**The project is in an early proof of concept state.**
